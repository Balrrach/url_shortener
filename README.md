## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**:  
  - **Go (Golang)** – The backend is built using Go for handling HTTP requests, generating short URLs, and interacting with the database.
  - **Gin** – A web framework for Go that simplifies routing and middleware.
  - **PostgreSQL** – A relational database for storing long URLs, their shortened versions, and other metadata like click count.

- **Frontend**:  
  - **HTML5** – Basic HTML structure for the user interface.
  - **CSS3** – Styling of the application using inline styles (or external stylesheets).
  - **JavaScript** – For client-side interactivity, such as making API requests and updating the UI dynamically.
  
- **Others**:
  - **Docker** – Used for containerizing the application and the PostgreSQL database for easier deployment.
  - **Docker Compose** – Simplifies managing multi-container applications (e.g., running both the Go app and PostgreSQL together).
